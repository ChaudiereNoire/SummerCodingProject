# SummerCodingProject
Summer of 2018 - Java Coding Project w/ Raspberry Pi

Team 4949, the Parkdale High School Robopanthers, and Team 6239, the Irrantional Engineers of Upper Marlboro, got together for a headfirst dive into programming control systems.  Our plan was to build a robot up from scratch with unknown parts, set up the requirements, find the limits, code to meet our reruireements, and just get as far as we could in one day a week at the local high school.  The code that we came up with runs, but it is far from perfect.

I forgot about this.  We ended up storing the code and documents on Googlde Drive.  I should see about porting it to this location for future classes.
